        // /*
        // There are two team in gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas.
        // They compete against each other 3 times.
        // The winner with highest average score wins the a trophy!

        // 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
        // 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).
        // 3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule,, a team only wins if it has a higher score that the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points.
        // HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
        // 4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or erual 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

        // TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89.
        // Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
        // TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. 
        // Koalas score 109, 95 and 123.
        // TEST DATA BONUS 2: Dolphins score  97, 112 and 101.
        // Koalas score 109, 95 and 106.
