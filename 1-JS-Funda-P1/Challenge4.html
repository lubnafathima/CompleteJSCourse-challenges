        // Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. 
        // In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different tip is 20%.

        // Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. 
        // It's not allowed to use an if/else statement
        // (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
        // 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). 
        // Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and total value 316.25'

        // TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
        // */
        
        // const bill = 275;
        // const bill = 40;
        const bill = 430;

        const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <=300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill > 300 ? bill * 0.2 : bill * 0;
        console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and total value ${bill + tip}`);
