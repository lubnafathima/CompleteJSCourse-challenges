        // Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphines and the koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
        // Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated
        // (so one average score per team)
        // A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

        // 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
        // 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
        // 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters
        // ("avgDolphins" and "avgKoals"), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, accourding to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)",
        // 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
        // 5. Ignore draws this time.

        // TEST DATA 1: Dolphines score 44, 23, and 71.
        // Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
        // TEST DATA 1: Dolphines score 85, 54, and 41.
        // Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

        // HINT: To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
        // HINT: To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B. Apply this to the team's average scores
        // */
